# Call Tracking on Rails

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/call-tracking-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/call-tracking-rails)

## Quickstart

### Create a TwiML App

This project is configured to use a **TwiML App**, which allows us to easily set the voice URLs for all Twilio phone numbers we purchase in this app.

Create a new TwiML app at https://www.twilio.com/user/account/apps/add and use its `Sid` as the `TWIML_APPLICATION_SID` environment variable wherever you run this app.

   ```
   export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your account sid

   ```

   Also export the SID for the TwiML App you created above:
